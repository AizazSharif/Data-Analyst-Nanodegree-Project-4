# Explore and Summarize Data Using R

In this project, you will use R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore relationships in one variable to multiple variables and to explore a selected data (Titanic Dataset in this case) set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies

## Installation

* Install R-base from [here](http://cran.r-project.org/)
* Install R-Studio from [here](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

* Clone the GitHub repository.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/AizazSharif/P4-Explore-and-Summarize-Data-Using-R.git
$ cd P4-Explore-and-Summarize-Data-Using-R
```
* Open R-Studio and Install these dependencies
```
install.packages("ggplot2", dependencies = T) 
install.packages("knitr", dependencies = T)
install.packages("dplyr", dependencies = T)

```

## Usage

In R-Studio, after installing all dependencies successfully, open the .Rmd File of the folder and run each cell (by hitting Ctrl+Enter) To go through each step from accessing the Dataset to Visualizing and running Statistics on single and multi-variables
